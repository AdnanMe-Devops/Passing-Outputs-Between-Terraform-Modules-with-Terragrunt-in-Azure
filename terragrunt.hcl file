The difference between the server and network Terragrunt configuration is that the server Terraform configuration has two dependencies. The Virtual Machine needs the Resource 
Group name and location and the Subnet ID to deploy. In order to specify multiple dependencies within the Terragrunt configuration, multiple dependency blocks are created. 
The data is then passed into the server folder Terraform configuration as variables:
